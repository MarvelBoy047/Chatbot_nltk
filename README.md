# Chatbot_nltk
The provided code is for building a simple chatbot using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
Libraries Used: The code uses several libraries, including NLTK for NLP, TFlearn for neural network creation, TensorFlow for machine learning, and other standard Python libraries for data manipulation and file handling.

## Data Loading: The code reads intent data from a JSON file called "intents.json," which contains predefined patterns, intents, and responses.

## Data Preprocessing: Text data is tokenized, stemmed using the Lancaster Stemmer, and converted to lowercase for consistency. The code extracts words and labels from the intent data.

## Data Preparation: The code prepares the training data by creating a bag-of-words representation of input patterns and one-hot encoding the intent labels.

## Model Architecture: The chatbot uses a feedforward neural network with three fully connected layers. The final layer uses softmax activation to predict the intent tag.

## Training and Saving: The model is trained on the prepared training data. It is saved to a file named "model.tflearn" for future use, avoiding the need for retraining.

## User Interaction: The chatbot provides a simple command-line interface for user interaction. Users can type messages, and the bot responds based on the trained model and predefined intents.
